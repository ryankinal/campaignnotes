	* Fumetsu thinks people abuse it

### Revealing Revelations to Tsuru

* Found a Kenku!
	* Buun convinced Tamahide to stop taking the elixir
	* Indirectly - convinced him that his soul was at risk
* Yoshi thinks that Buun no longer had a use for the Koi
	* That Buun has an agenda
* Particular knowledge can be a burden
	* Sharing this type of knowledge makes it heavier
	* Maybe Akifumi has that kind of knowledge
	* Maybe Akifumi was helping
* Should we stop our pursuit of the exports?
	* Yoshi: But... our customer. Through inaction.
	* Tsuru: Perhaps through action, we can get the same result
	* Fumetsu tries to get him to say what action, but he doesn't
* Fumetsu suggests moving forward with Moriko's Magical Taint-Buster as a way to maintain status
* Kasumi agrees
	* We should play to our strengths
* Tsuru agrees
	* But we need to defend against accusations (of allowing the Emperor to die)
	* But hey maybe it will be cool
	* Kasumi suggests maybe sending messages to the Crab
* Tsuru suggests dinner
	* Fuck yeah

### Sidebar - Imperial Lineage

* Next in line is Hantei Etsuhiko

### Dinner!

* There's some food... rice... probably
* Kasumi: "How can we best position ourselves as allies to Hantei Etsuhiko?"
	* Tsuru: Why do you ask?
	* Kasumi: He's next in line. Seems like a good idea.
	* Tsuru: He's probably not too pleased with the Koi
	* Yoshi: Could send an envoy. There are always... SECRET WAYS MUAHAHAHAA I'M YOSHIHIRO
	* Tsuru asks Yoshi to speak plainly, Yoshi refuses. Fumetsu rolls his eyes an excuses himself.
* Kasumi also leaves
* Yoshi says Fumetsu will be a problem
	* Because he's an idealist
	* He will need to be managed
* Tsuru: How is that any different than how I deal with you?
	* I know I'm a problem
	* But Fumetsu will be the best of us "to look good" when there's not much good to look at
* Tsuru: We must show honor to all of Rokugan
	* Between Yoshi, Moriko, and Kasumi, we lack the polish
	* Yoshi takes that as a compliment
* Tsuru: We need information more than ever
	* Tsuru: Whether Kitsune Tomo was working in the interest of...
	* Yoshi: Wait - we need this written down and kept silent
	* Tsuru: Info now, informed action later

### Yoshi checks the dead-drop

	* "If you're ready to declare war on the Celestial Order, put the red flag out your window."

### Fumetsu has dreams

* Standing at the edge of the lake where he dueled the Kami of the Red Lake
* The lake is red and glowing
* The ghost of his ancestor is floating above surface
* "Fumetsu, you are a man of honor. And yet so soon, you now spit on that honor, soiling yourself for fleeing gain. If you continue down this path, I cannot bear having my fate tied to yours."

### BREAKFAST!

* Pre-breakfast, Kasumi does her duty of delightfully dark and doom-filled divinations
* Tsuru is still tired, but perfectly coifed (koifed)
* Yoshi is mostly doing his own thing
* Tsuru suggests that maybe he needs Fumetsu for the meeting with the Emerald Magistrate
	* Or maybe not
	* Or maybe
* Kasumi consulted the sticks
	* They were cryptic
	* She asked if Kitsune Tomo was an individual or a group
	* "The Shadow of the Fox is cast only at night, when only Lord Moon is free to cast a shadow."
	* Emphasis on “only at night,” which could also mean “part of a whole,” “yang,” “intermittent.”
	* Rather than individuals forming Tomo, Tomo is a part of something else

### Yoshi

* Daijiro speaks with Yoshi
	* "Hey... ummm... red flag?"
	* "Other boss says we're beginning the initiation"

	* Mostly reclaimed by nature
	* Foundations and some almost standing buildings
* Building with 3 walls still up
	* Oil light from inside
	* Four figures inside

		* All concealing their faces
		* 2 have armor & mempo

* Cowled person: "Why have you come to us?"
	* "To break the wheel"
	* Cowled nods
* Ogre-face: "Why have you changed your mind? We tried to recruit you before."
	* "The order is unjust. We have opportunities to break it."
	* Cowled nods
* Ogre-face: "Sounds good. We wish humankind to rule themselves, without intervention of gods. Let humans be free."
* Yoshi: "Is this is a mission only, or has there been actual progress?"
	* The mission has been ongoing for nearly a thousand years. A subtle, delicate game.
* Yoshi: "What do I benefit?"
	* You contribute
* Yoshi: "But..."
	* But what?
	* "Maybe some information, resources, etc?"
	* Bruh. Obvs.
	* "Ears and eyes in the Seppun guard and within the Fox"
		* Daijiro grins: "You'll all that and more."
* Just has to complete a task
	* The Imperials are blaming the Hare for something one of them did
	* Using the Fox clan. Needs to be undone.

	* Like Tamahide?
* They argue for a while
* Tsuru orders Yoshi to frame the Fox

### Tsuru & Kasumi

* She divined
	* "The fortunes of the Koi have passed through a weir. You can’t go back the way you came - it is forever closed to you. You can only move forward, toward the new and frightening. But beware! A weir is a trap set by beings far more powerful than yourself.""
* She interprets this as "we can't make the export"
* The only way forward is forward
* There are fishermen on the banks
* Something something
* Arguing over sake

### Fumetsu & Chozu

* Tamahide's techniques
	* Are they honorable? Nope.
	* Bad spiritually too.
	* Fumetsu already knows that
* Any secrets you can reveal?
	* Hermit Buun - Yoshi might know him
* The Koi as you know it died with Tamahide I think you have the ability to see the clan reborn
* The emperor does what the order demands
	* How could that be wrong?

### Fumetsu & Yoshi

* Fumetsu walks into the Filthy Pond
	* Criminals scatter
* Can we find Buun?
	* Yoshi's father probably can

	* He has knowledge we need
	* But apparently it's dangerous
	* Tamahide didn't respect the order of things
	* Buun caused Okifumi to lose respect for Tamahide
		* "Impermanence is beauty."
	* Buun convinced Tamahide to die
	* Unlike the others - like the dark emperor (fuckin' blasphemy)
* Are we going to meet Buun?
* Kasumi has seen Buun before
	* Doesn't know it was him
	* Saw him on the way back from the bandit camp
	* Strange man in a tree - vanished in a second

	* Just like his mother used to make
	* Yoshi and his dad are cute
* Okifumi grabs Fumetsu as he's leaving

### Tsuru

* Hachi arrives with a minor Otomo
* Audience with Sango
	* She's exuding confidence and power
* Which great clans support
	* Fox
		* Crane - Reliable ally
		* Unicorn - Reliable ally
	* Hare
		* No great allies in court
		* No known enemies either
	* Sparrow
		* Crane - Relible ally

* What does Tamahide's death mean?
* How is the Emperor doing?
	* Saddened by Tamahide's death
	* Remains in good health. He's immortal. Duh.
	* Reinforces exports. It would bring ill tidings to deprive the Emperor.
	* Tamahide's work must continue. This is clearly a threat.

### Comin' Down the Mountain

* Path is blocked by an old man
	* Backpack full of bamboo
	* Names: Akifumi? Buun? Prefers Akifumi.
* Kasumi recognizes him, but... no, he couldn't be
* Fumetsu takes his bundle
* Kasumi tells him she recognizes him
	* "Did I  not see you four days ago?"
	* Yep
* Talk of the battle
	* Why? Because Hanako
	* Was 35 men a good price? I suppose
	* There was also blood magic though
* He's been watching us
	* Watched Okifumi too
* Yoshi: "You must be real old. Is that because of... exports."
	* Nope. The Celestial Order allows such things sometimes.
	* "I have fewer of my old friends every year. It's not that nice."
* Convinced Tamahide to follow Celestial Order long ago, and recently
	* "Before all was lost" (his soul)
	* He had a good soul, but gaijin magic corrupted him
	* But damned the Koi, according to Yoshi
* Survival is incidental - we are reborn anyway
	* To disrupt the cycle is to rob yourself of wholeness
* Yoshi: "yeah, but you're really old"
	* Kasumi: "what burdens do you bear?"
	* If I tell you, what will it change? Will you continue power struggles?
* Yoshi: "What will your truth do to ameliorate the pain around us?"
	* "I find your lack of faith disturbing."
	* You take the suffering of those below you as a fault in the system
	* Buun comes from a time long before people
* BUUN CHANGES INTO A BLACKBIRD
	* Fumetsu: The greatest swordsmen were trained by a Kenku master
	* Kasumi knows they are immortal
* Fumetsu: Are all who violate the order doomed to fall?
	* B: Eventually. But even doom is impermanent.
	* F: "I would like to learn from you, so I can teach the rest of the Koi."
	* B: You'd have to choose who to honor.
	* F: Maybe not the Koi?
	* Yoshi: You'd betray us, Fumetsu?
	* F: Is it betrayal though?
* Kasumi: Can the Koi be redeemed?
	* It will be hard
	* The young Chozu has witnessed much and said little
		* Only in his first life on the path
		* But he can guide the Koi
	* You all know what the right choice to make is, don't shy away from it.

## Session 10 - 5/19/20

### Oh Shit a Gaijin

* Kasumi reveals her divination
	* The Gaki fed on blackness/void/corruption in Tamahide

		* A little bit of puffy eyes
	* Yoshi introduces the gaijin
		* "That's an awfully presumptuous tone for a servant" (lul)
		* There's an "ah-ha" moment from Koharu
		* He presents the gift

		* Fumetsu bows, etc.
		* "You're expecting trouble?"
			* "Yep. Always."
* Cho(z|s)u speaks
	* It's a good speech
	* Heartfelt, sincere, but generic
		* Elevated his ancestors from ronin to the high status of a minor clan
		* Friend of the emperor
		* Everybody should be like Tamahide and raise that status of ancestors
		* Tamahide will be rewarded by coming back as something important
		* IF HE'S NOT ELEVATED TO THE PURE LANDS OF ENLIGHTENMENT
		* Such niceties
* Koharu says some stuff
	* Her childhood
* Haruto as acting daimyo lights the pyre
	* Bids fond farewell
	* Chokes up
	* Breaks On
	* He actually does pretty well
	* Expected him to be much more embarrassing
* White shroud, tied to the pyre, rough outline of a human

* Yoshi
	* "Tamahide lived for a long time. Did your people have anything to do with that?"

	* Not a parlor trick, or a spell, but a deep truth
	* Tamahide has never taught anyone how to make the elixir
	* Kasumi knows it includes Shinese's Footprint, ginseng, and other herbals
	* If anybody knows it's probably [Hannah's Character]'s mother
	* Kasumi learned stuff about box
		* Thickens the barriers to the spirit realm
		* Also maybe soothing magic
	* Somebody has to do something to figure out the export
		* Or Al-Hazir
		* Or whatever
	* Tsuru may have some pull, but doesn't presume
	* Yoshi is gonna go at it
		* "Do whatever you have to, Yoshi"
* Who was that mysterious man?
* How will the Koi continue production of the elixir?
* Will Tamahide die?
* Find out next time on *The Secrets of the Koi Clan*
