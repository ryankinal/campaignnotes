# Relationships and Bushido

## Moriko - Honor and Courage

Moriko honors her family and her clan by holding her art to a high standard. The Koi Shugenja school, while young, is ambitious and her devotion to it takes courage.

## Yoshi - Compassion and Duty

Clearly cares for the Koi, and will do anything to make sure we survive. At any cost. To himself, to Rokugan, to others. He cares not only for the Samurai, but for the peasants - for the weak among us.

### Telling off Yoshihiro

You speak as if you are the Emperor himself, without respect or humility. You lay back and drink yourself into stupors in your tiny castle in a tiny corner of our tiny lands, surrounded by criminals and addicts, and yet you condescend to those of us with standing and honor. How do you think it looks when you walk into the keep drunk, with blood on your fists, and straight into the rooms of the man who may be the next Koi Daimyo? You are not invisible and your influence is not unseen, regardless of whether we speak of your deeds. My guards see you, and they talk. They know your reputation, and if they know your reputation, then there are certainly many others who also do. Be better, Yoshihiro. Be more honorable, or be more invisible. The in-between is only hurting us.

## Tsuru - Duty and Sincerity

Had responsibility thrust upon him prematurely, and handles it well. He does what he has to for the Koi while maintaining his honor and that of the Koi.

## Kasumi - Courage and Honesty

There are some places a bushi cannot go, and she dives head first into them. Her ambition and courage in regard to Gaki, Divination, and the Kami.

## Seina - Sincerity? Courtesy? - Not sure yet

Haven't interacted with Seina much yet. Don't have a good idea of her character.

# Relevant NPCs

## Hanako - Wife

* Head magistrate of Ashinagabashi Province
	* Chief law-enforcement agents
* Kind, helpful
* Runs a tight household
* Taking on responsibility that her mother never had

## Umiko (She/Her) - Chief Magistrate of Chuugan Province

* Kitayama is in Chuugan - it was routed by Gaki
* Blamed by Tsuru

## Kano (He/Him)

* Sensei of the Koi Kenjutsu School
* Accidental adversary

## Daidoji Sato (She/Her)

* Sister, Crane Clan
* Married into Daidoji
* Most trusted friend

# Goals

## Lead the Koi into a new era

* Encourage honesty and compassion
* Push Moriko's school

## Fix the Celestial Order

The Celestial Order is not broken. It can't be. It's simply fact. But there are those who abuse it. Who seek to break it. Those that are higher in the Order forget that they lived previous lives that were lower. Hopefully those who shirk it can be negotiated with. If not, they must be killed.

## Improve the Koi Samurai

They're currently kind of slapdash. Encourage good swordsmanship and strict adherence to Bushido.

## Quash the Criminal Element

There's clearly a criminal element in Koi lands. Yoshihiro is part of it, and has no qualms about referencing it, though he hides actual deeds from anybody important. Remove this element from Koi lands.

## Instate Hanako as Governor of Enzan Province

She'd be good at it. Maybe we make it a bit safer first.

## Put my ancestors to rest - Done?

Battle of the Hour of the Wolf and all that
