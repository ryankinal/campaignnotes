# Artifacts

## The Eye of Malica

A spherical pendant of polished, translucent quartz, smooth on the outside but cracked in the center, giving the appearance of containing a tangle of fine thread. It is bound to a simple leather thong with silver wires wrapped precisely around it. These are arranged in three parallels and five meridians, and give the appearance of a cage. The pendant contains the disembodied spirit of Malica, who considers anyone bearing the pendant to be her captor, and will look for any way to escape.

While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in Perception. You may also use an action at will to cast Scrying as a level 19 Bard. When you use this item to cast Scrying, there is a 50% chance Malica will attempt to escape the pendant and possess your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until Malica is banished using magic such as Dispel Evil and Good.

## The Ahyacasque

A smooth full-face helm of silver and bronze, inlaid with gold at the seams. The wearer gains the favor of the goddess Ahyahar, but the ire of the god[dess] [name of other deity]. While attuned to this item and wearing it, you gain resistance to necrotic damage and regain 1d6 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point. However, undead in the region are aware of your presence and will seek you out. Any living humanoid that dies in your presence as a 10% chance of being reawakened as undead.

In dire circumstances, you may call upon Ahyahar for a favor. If this favor is deemed Good and Selfless in her eyes, she will grant it, but at the cost of your life. You will be counted among her blessed, and your spirit will be immediately transported to the afterlife. You may not be resurrected.

## The Feasting Table

A long dining table of varnished wood. The wood, as far as anyone can tell, is unique. Its species is unlike any other in the world. Otherwise, however, the table is unremarkable. It is plain and simple, only marked by its length and its strong magical aura.

Those who gather around the table are treated to the finest of feasts, and may eat as much as they desire seemingly with no end. In addition, they are calmed and pacified. Enemies, while they may still disagree, will feel no violent tendency during the feast or for 1d4 days afterward.
