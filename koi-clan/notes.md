# Notes

## Session 2 - 4/24/20

* Excellent summary by Tim

## Session 1 - 4/21/20

* Tamahide had been sprightly up until the last 6 months
	* Spent his 98th birthday sparring with grandchildren, and doing quite well for his ange
	* Suddenly took a turn for the worse a few weeks later - aged 40 years in weeks
* His children never lead, but took part in a decadent semi-retirement
* Tsuru has taken up the burden of leadership
	* Father Haruto is figurehead
		* 69 years old and looks it
		* Not very good at it, because never worked
* In Tamahide's bed chamber - he appears to be on his death bed
	* Terrifying to look on
		* Bulbous pustules
		* Goiter
		* Lesions
		* Devoid of fat
	* Others here:
		* Chouzu - local head monk - oversees Temple to Jurojin
			* Head of chamber, saying prayers with chunky rosary
		* Otomo Sango - not a member of the family or a permanent resident of the province
			* Granddaughter of Emperor (holy shit)
			* Has been a liason between Imperial Family and Tamahide
* Tsuru is stoic and respectful, Haruto is openly weeping - how embarrassing
* Guard busts in "Sorry, he insisted"
	* Tall man enters, flowing off-white linen garments
	* Long forked black beard
	* Olive-colored skin
* Tsuru steps up "What is the meaning of this?"
	* "Is not worry, is old friend. Al-Hazim is here to say goodbye."
	* Clearly a gaijin (foreigner)
* Kasumi casts a spell to learn stuff about him
	* Mood is "concerned"
* Yoshi says "Welcome, thank you for your presence."
* Chozu tells Al-Hazim that he must leave
	* "Don't worry, this won't take long."
* Whole room is stunned
	* Pushes aside Haruto
	* Whispers in a gaijin language
	* Tamahide responds "It is good, old friend. It is good."
* Al-Hazir reaches into his robes
	* We all react semi-aggressively
	* Small wooden box, brass hinges placed on his bed
	* "Peace be upon you all, I will leave you to mourn."
* "Lord still lives
* Kasumi wants to identify/detect magic
	* Tabling this for now, because details not filled in
	* Succeeded on the spell
* Yoshi fallows Al-Hazim
	* Walking with "big dick energy" to leave the building
	* Yoshi double-times to reach him
	* Yoshi: "Sir, can I have a moment with you?"
	* Al-Hazim: "Yes. Whaddya want?"
	* Yoshi: "I know how important you are for what we do."
	* Al-Hazim: "Okay. Is this all you want to say?"
	* Yoshi: "Can we continue our relationship?"
	* Al-Hazim: "Yep. Don't worry. Don't find us, we'll find you. You are a small man in this machine."
	* He smiles kindly and leaves. Guards aren't challenging him.
	* Leaves on a black stallion waiting for him - not Rokugani
* Tsuru says we'll find whoever put this curse on Tamahide
* Tamahide repeats "It's okay"
* All but closest kin leave
	* Tsuru stays
	* Haruto asks all sorts of questions
* Kasumi reveals to Yoshi and Fumetsu Al-Hazim's concerned mood
* Yoshi reveals what he saw
	* Has ideas regarding nature of relationship with Al-Hazim
	* Trading relationship? Maybe only w/Daimyo?
* Kasumi searches her knowledge
	* The Burning Sands - desert home to nomadic tribes
	* City - Medinaat Al-Salaam - rumored to be magnificent, beautiful, unlike anything in Rokugan
	* He's from there - fucking far away
* Discussion of Tsuru's curse
	* Nobody has heard of anything
	* Yoshi thinks he was "just flapping his mouth"
	* Might have to do with "exports"
* Otomo Sango speaks up
	* It is Sango's purpose to ensure that the "exports" continue: "Do whatever is needed."
	* All bow deeply
	* Excuses herself
* Find a quiet place to discuss exports
	* Tsuru suggests it's not magic keeping Tamahide alive
	* Not a parlor trick, or a spell, but a deep truth
	* Tamahide has never taught anyone how to make the elixir
	* Kasumi knows it includes Shinese's Footprint, ginseng, and other herbals
	* If anybody knows it's probably [Hannah's Character]'s mother
	* Kasumi learned stuff about box
		* Thickens the barriers to the spirit realm
		* Also maybe soothing magic
	* Somebody has to do something to figure out the export
		* Or Al-Hazir
		* Or whatever
	* Tsuru may have some pull, but doesn't presume
	* Yoshi is gonna go at it
		* "Do whatever you have to, Yoshi"
* Who was that mysterious man?
* How will the Koi continue production of the elixir?
* Will Tamahide die?
* Find out next time on *The Secrets of the Koi Clan*

## Session 0.5 - 4/21/20

* History

		* Other potions, tinctures, salves, etc. produced by disciples of Benika (40%)
