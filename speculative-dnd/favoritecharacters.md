# Favorite Characters

I've been creating a lot of characters recently. Here are some of my favorites.

## Gardram - Water Genasi Barbarian

The rage of a Water Genasi is like an ocean swell that has finally broken. It is always there, whether it is up or down, but a change in what lies underneath can cause it to become violent, crashing down upon anything unlucky enough to be caught at the breakpoint.

Gardram has only two outlets for their emotions - hand drums, and violence. If you're lucky, you'll hear the drums. If you're not, you might never hear anything ever again.

## Gilleanas Aethalena - Eladrin Warlock

Gilly remembers the Feywild fondly. The Feywild does not remember Gilly fondly at all. A charlatan and a conman, Gilleanas Aethalena was banished to the mortal realm for crimes against the crown. The only connection he retains is to a powerful Archfey, who grants Gilly spells in exhange for favors, pushing the entity's unknown agenda in the mortal realm.

In a way, Gilly is lucky. There are those in the Feywild who want his head, but they do not often leave there.

## Horver Loofollue - Forest Gnome (Wizard/Druid)

Typically, Forest Gnomes are associated with illusion, trickery, and deceit. Horver despises all of these, denouncing the study of illusion and instead pursuing truth. Facts, figures, experiments, and knowledge are what matter to Horver, and he seeks them obsessively. Knowledge is infinite, and thus so is possibility.

Horver compulsively shares knowledge. He's willing to teach, yes, but he's also quick to share a secret, regardless of the consequences.

## Rudiger - Human Fighter

Rudiger has seen exactly one horrible, life-changing event, and that was enough for him to leave behind the life of a soldier. One might think this would cause a certain darkness in him, and truth be told, it has. But you would never know it. He hides it well, and shows a friendly, compassionate face to the world around him.

He values freedom, independence, and fairness, and will fight to secure those things for everybody and anybody. Those who do the same are his valued friends, for whom he would give up his life if necessary.

## Flynwan - Tiefling Rogue

Flynwan grew up in the church. He learned its lessons and its ways, but found a talent for... disposing of the church's enemies. This was quite useful for a number of reasons, but it meant that he could not move up in the ranks of the priesthood. Murder is wrong, you see, but it is also necessary. Flynwan was called upon to make that sacrifice, and service to the church is all he ever wanted and all he ever could want.

Flynwan is pious and devout. Other gods and other religions are incorrect, and he will say so. It follows that his religion is absolutely correct. The word of his god, often spoken through the higher-up priests, is infallible, and he will follow orders blindly.
