		* "All I got is a horrible ritual and Kiku in the dungeon"
	* Tsuru: "Could Kiku be the bloodspeaker?"
		* "Nah, she's weak. Not strong enough to be a bloodspeaker."
		* "Also, hey, there's this ritual where a bloodspeaker syphons their own taint off to somebody else."
	* Tsuru: "If that's true, then there's no justice. The taint is the punishment. It's the indicator."
	* Danbe appears - "Then something must be wrong with the celestial order."
		* Ryuske: "Rude."

	* Yoshi: "I know how important you are for what we do."
	* Al-Hazim: "Okay. Is this all you want to say?"
	* Yoshi: "Can we continue our relationship?"
	* Al-Hazim: "Yep. Don't worry. Don't find us, we'll find you. You are a small man in this machine."
	* He smiles kindly and leaves. Guards aren't challenging him.
	* Leaves on a black stallion waiting for him - not Rokugani
* Tsuru says we'll find whoever put this curse on Tamahide
* Tamahide repeats "It's okay"
* All but closest kin leave
	* Tsuru stays
	* Haruto asks all sorts of questions
* Kasumi reveals to Yoshi and Fumetsu Al-Hazim's concerned mood
* Yoshi reveals what he saw
	* Has ideas regarding nature of relationship with Al-Hazim
	* Trading relationship? Maybe only w/Daimyo?
* Kasumi searches her knowledge
	* The Burning Sands - desert home to nomadic tribes
	* City - Medinaat Al-Salaam - rumored to be magnificent, beautiful, unlike anything in Rokugan
	* He's from there - fucking far away
* Discussion of Tsuru's curse
	* Nobody has heard of anything
	* Yoshi thinks he was "just flapping his mouth"
	* Might have to do with "exports"
* Otomo Sango speaks up
	* It is Sango's purpose to ensure that the "exports" continue: "Do whatever is needed."
	* All bow deeply
	* Excuses herself
* Find a quiet place to discuss exports
	* Tsuru suggests it's not magic keeping Tamahide alive
	* Not a parlor trick, or a spell, but a deep truth
	* Tamahide has never taught anyone how to make the elixir
	* Kasumi knows it includes Shinese's Footprint, ginseng, and other herbals
	* If anybody knows it's probably [Hannah's Character]'s mother
	* Kasumi learned stuff about box
		* Thickens the barriers to the spirit realm
		* Also maybe soothing magic
	* Somebody has to do something to figure out the export
		* Or Al-Hazir
		* Or whatever
	* Tsuru may have some pull, but doesn't presume
	* Yoshi is gonna go at it
		* "Do whatever you have to, Yoshi"
* Who was that mysterious man?
* How will the Koi continue production of the elixir?
* Will Tamahide die?
* Find out next time on *The Secrets of the Koi Clan*
